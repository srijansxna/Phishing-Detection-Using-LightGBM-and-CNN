Phishing attacks are one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats, tricking users into revealing sensitive information through malicious URLs and websites.
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques by analyzing URL-based features and domain characteristics.
The system is trained on a combination of phishing URLs and legitimate website data, enabling it to learn patterns that distinguish malicious links from safe ones.

The project uses the following datasets:
Dataset	Description
openPhish.csv	Contains known phishing URLs
verified_online.csv	Verified legitimate websites
tranco_8LKJV.csv	Top-ranked legitimate domains from Tranco

The trained models demonstrate strong performance in distinguishing phishing URLs from legitimate ones.
Feature-based URL analysis proves to be an effective and lightweight approach for phishing detection.
